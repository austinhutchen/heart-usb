# heart-usb
simple script I made with an ATTINY85 that, upon plugin to any mac, gains access, opens terminal, and draws out a heart, and then prints I love you.
Only compatible with digikey devices. You can buy them for cheap on ebayu, at around $6 currently, and run this script on anyones computer. I suggest the ebay seller here : https://www.ebay.com/itm/191867231399
